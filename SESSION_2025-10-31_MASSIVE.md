2. **Character Network** integration was already complete in code
3. **Run Manager** working perfectly out of the box
4. **Health Aggregator** made monitoring trivial
5. **Git workflow** smooth with descriptive commits

### Challenges Overcome:
1. **Health Aggregator syntax errors** - fixed quickly
2. **BlockWorld AI** wrong script name - found correct one
3. **Reality Integration** appeared offline - was actually running
4. **Services coordination** - Eternal Daemon solved this elegantly

### Technical Debt:
1. **Groq API Key** not configured (affects AI quality)
2. **OpenAI API Key** missing (affects Vector Search)
3. **2-4 services** still not responding (minor)
4. **Tests** don't exist yet (M3 priority)
