## 🎯 DECISION FRAMEWORK

**When stuck, ask:**

### Should I do this task NOW?

```
                  Is it P0/P1?
                       │
              ┌────────┴────────┐
            YES                 NO
              │                  │
         Does it block      Can it wait
         other tasks?       until next
              │             week/month?
         ┌────┴────┐             │
       YES        NO             │
        │          │             │
    DO NOW    DO AFTER P0    DEFER/DELETE
```

### Priority Matrix
