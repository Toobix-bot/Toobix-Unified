## 🚨 Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
- None

### Risks (Week 1)
- ⚠️ Time estimation might be optimistic
- ⚠️ Auth integration could take longer
- ⚠️ Database schema changes might break existing data

### Mitigation
- Focus on P0 tasks only
- Skip nice-to-have features
- Test thoroughly before moving on

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation upfront saves time
- ✅ Creating guides before implementation clarifies requirements
- ✅ Git workflow with tags makes progress visible

### What to Improve
- 🔄 Break down larger tasks into smaller chunks
- 🔄 Test more frequently during implementation
- 🔄 Document decisions as they're made

---

## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### October 4 Decisions
1. **Documentation First:** Addressed all external feedback before continuing development
2. **Guides Over Code:** Created setup guides so implementation is straightforward
3. **Git Tags:** Started using semantic versioning from alpha stage
4. **Testing Strategy:** Vitest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E

### Key Insights
- External feedback (Chatty) was extremely valuable
- Having a clear 3-month plan reduces anxiety
- Breaking down work into daily tasks makes progress measurable
