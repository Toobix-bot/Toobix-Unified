## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ System Analysis & Planning
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Files Created:**
- `IDLE_GAME_EXPANSION_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive 8-week roadmap

**What Was Done:**
- Analyzed existing Story-Idle Game system
- Designed complete expansion with:
  - Resources system (7 resource types)
  - Buildings (10+ buildings)
  - Characters (5 new companions)
  - Mini-games (4 games)
  - Prestige system
  - Dashboard integration
- Created detailed implementation roadmap

---

### 2. ✅ Passive Resource System
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Files Created:**
- `packages/story-idle/src/engine/resource-manager.ts` (408 lines)
- `packages/story-idle/src/engine/passive-generator.ts` (283 lines)
- `packages/story-idle/src/engine/game-state-extended.ts` (450+ lines)

**What Was Implemented:**

#### Resource Manager
- 7 Resource Types:
  - ⚡ Code Energy (base currency)
  - 🎨 Creativity Points
  - 📚 Wisdom Tokens
  - 💝 Love Shards
  - 🧠 Consciousness (high-tier)
  - ☯️ Harmony (balance)
  - ✨ Inspiration (rare)

- Features:
  - Resource caps (upgradable)
  - Generation rates (per minute)
  - Multipliers (from stats/buildings)
  - Add/spend/check operations
  - Serialization support

#### Passive Generator
- Time-based generation (works offline!)
- Max offline time: 24 hours (configurable)
- Stat-based bonuses:
  - High Creativity → More Creativity Points
  - High Wisdom → More Wisdom Tokens
  - High Love → More Love Shards
  - High average stats → Consciousness
- Real-time tick system (updates every minute)
- Offline rewards calculation
- Beautiful "Welcome Back" messages

#### Extended Game State
- Full resource state persistence
- Integration with existing game state
- Migration system from old → new state
- Resource display formatting
- Generation rate summaries

**Example Output:**
```
✨ Welcome back! You were away for 2h 30m

📦 Resources Generated:
   +150 codeEnergy
   +15 creativityPoints
   +12 wisdomTokens
   +7 loveShards

⚠️  Some resources hit their cap: codeEnergy
   Consider upgrading storage!
```

### 3. ✅ Building System
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Files Created:**
- `packages/story-idle/src/engine/building-manager.ts` (700+ lines)

**What Was Implemented:**

#### 10+ Buildings Across 3 Categories:

**🏛️ Infrastructure** (Basic resource generators):
1. **Code Monastery** (10 levels)
   - Generates Code Energy passively
   - Level 1: +1/min → Level 10: +1000/min
   - Cost scales exponentially

2. **Library of Wisdom** (8 levels)
   - Generates Wisdom Tokens
   - Unlocks at 30 Wisdom stat
   - Costs energy + creativity/wisdom

3. **Dream Studio** (8 levels)
   - Generates Creativity Points
   - Unlocks at 40 Creativity stat
   - Beautiful scaling

4. **Peace Garden** (6 levels)
   - Generates Love Shards
   - Unlocks at 25 Peace stat
   - Uses Love Shards as cost

**🗼 Advanced Buildings** (High-tier, powerful):
5. **Consciousness Tower** (5 levels)
   - Generates Consciousness resource
   - Unlocks at Level 5 + 60 Wisdom/Creativity
   - Expensive but game-changing

6. **Harmony Nexus** (5 levels)
   - Generates Harmony + multiplies all resources
   - Requires "Balanced Master" achievement
   - End-game building

**🎨 Decorations** (Cosmetic + bonuses):
7. **Zen Fountain** - +2% peace generation
8. **Rainbow Bridge** - +5% all resources
9. **Luna's Shrine** - +10% relationship growth

#### Building Features:
- Unlock Requirements:
  - Player level
  - Stat requirements
  - Completed quests
  - Achievements
- Upgrade system (costs scale)
- Effects:
  - Generate resources
  - Multiply rates
  - Increase caps
  - Special bonuses
- Full state management
- Beautiful UI integration ready

## 📈 Impact

**Before:**
- Commits → XP/Stats
- Manual progression only
- No passive gameplay

**After:**
- Commits → XP/Stats + Resources
- Passive resource generation
- Buildings multiply output
- Offline accumulation
- Full idle game loop!
