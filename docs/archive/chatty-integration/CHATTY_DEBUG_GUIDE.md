# 🆘 TASKGROUP ERROR - DEBUGGING GUIDE FOR CHATTY

**Date:** October 4, 2025 - 23:45  
**Status:** ⚠️ **ERROR PERSISTS** - Need Chatty's help to debug

---

## 🔍 PROBLEM

**Error (from Chatty):**
```
Fehler beim Erstellen des Konnektors
unhandled errors in a TaskGroup (1 sub-exception)
```

**Our Status:**
- ✅ Server is running (46 tools)
- ✅ All endpoints tested manually (working)
- ✅ Scope error fixed (startTime moved outside try)
- ❌ **Chatty still gets TaskGroup error**

**This means:** Chatty is doing something **different** than our tests!

---

## 🎯 WHAT WE NEED FROM CHATTY

### 1. **Check ngrok Web Interface**

Open in browser: **http://127.0.0.1:4040**

Look for:
- What URL did Chatty request?
- What HTTP method? (GET/POST)
- What headers did Chatty send?
- What was the request body?
- What was the response status code?
- What was the response body?

**Screenshot or copy-paste this info!**

---

### 2. **What Protocol Does Chatty Expect?**

Chatty might be expecting:

**Option A: SSE (Server-Sent Events)**
```
Connection: keep-alive
Accept: text/event-stream
```
→ Our server does NOT support SSE! This would cause TaskGroup error!

**Option B: JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP**
```
Content-Type: application/json
POST /mcp
```
→ Our server DOES support this! ✅

**Option C: Standard MCP Discovery**
```
GET / → Discovery
POST /mcp → Methods
```
→ Our server DOES support this! ✅

**Which one is Chatty trying?**

---

### 3. **What URL is Chatty Using?**

**Correct URLs:**
```
✅ https://multiplicative-unapprehendably-marisha.ngrok-free.dev/
✅ https://multiplicative-unapprehendably-marisha.ngrok-free.dev/mcp
✅ https://multiplicative-unapprehendably-marisha.ngrok-free.dev/invoke
```

**Wrong URLs:**
```
❌ https://multiplicative-unapprehendably-marisha.ngrok-free.dev/sse
❌ https://multiplicative-unapprehendably-marisha.ngrok-free.dev/stream
❌ ws://multiplicative-unapprehendably-marisha.ngrok-free.dev/
```

**Which URL is in Chatty's connector config?**

---

### 4. **Is Chatty Setting the Required Header?**

**CRITICAL:** ngrok Free requires this header:
```
ngrok-skip-browser-warning: true
```

**Without this header:**
- ngrok returns HTML instead of JSON
- Parsing fails → TaskGroup error!

**Is Chatty sending this header?**

---

## 🧪 MANUAL TESTS FOR CHATTY

### Test 1: Discovery (GET /)
```bash
curl -H "ngrok-skip-browser-warning: true" \
  https://multiplicative-unapprehendably-marisha.ngrok-free.dev/
```

**Expected:** JSON with protocol, server, capabilities, endpoints, tools

**If you get HTML:** Header is missing!

---

### Test 2: Health Check (GET /health)
```bash
curl -H "ngrok-skip-browser-warning: true" \
  https://multiplicative-unapprehendably-marisha.ngrok-free.dev/health
```

**Expected:** `{"status":"healthy","toolCount":46,"timestamp":...}`

**If you get HTML:** Header is missing!

---

### Test 3: MCP Initialize (POST /mcp)
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "ngrok-skip-browser-warning: true" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "initialize",
    "params": {
      "protocolVersion": "1.0.0",
      "clientInfo": {"name": "chatty", "version": "1.0"}
    },
    "id": 1
  }' \
  https://multiplicative-unapprehendably-marisha.ngrok-free.dev/mcp
```

**Expected:** `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"protocolVersion":"1.0.0",...}}`

**If you get error:** Check request format!

---

### Test 4: Tools List (POST /mcp)
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "ngrok-skip-browser-warning: true" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/list",
    "params": {},
    "id": 2
  }' \
  https://multiplicative-unapprehendably-marisha.ngrok-free.dev/mcp
```

**Expected:** `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"result":{"tools":[...46 tools...]}}`

---

### Test 5: Tool Call - ping (POST /mcp)
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "ngrok-skip-browser-warning: true" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "ping",
      "arguments": {}
    },
    "id": 3
  }' \
  https://multiplicative-unapprehendably-marisha.ngrok-free.dev/mcp
```

**Expected:** `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"result":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"..."}]}}`

---

## 🔍 COMMON CAUSES OF TASKGROUP ERROR

### Cause 1: Missing ngrok Header ⚠️ **MOST LIKELY**
**Symptom:** Connector tries to parse HTML as JSON
**Solution:** Add `ngrok-skip-browser-warning: true` to all requests

### Cause 2: SSE/Streaming Expected ⚠️ **POSSIBLE**
**Symptom:** Connector expects Server-Sent Events
**Solution:** We don't support SSE! Use JSON-RPC 2.0 instead

### Cause 3: Wrong Endpoint
**Symptom:** 404 Not Found
**Solution:** Use `/mcp` not `/stream` or `/sse`

### Cause 4: Timeout (>30s)
**Symptom:** Request times out
**Solution:** Use fast tools first (`ping`, `soul_state`)

### Cause 5: Concurrent Requests
**Symptom:** Multiple requests at once overwhelm server
**Solution:** Do requests sequentially (initialize → list → call)

## 📋 CHATTY CONNECTOR CHECKLIST

- [ ] URL: `https://multiplicative-unapprehendably-marisha.ngrok-free.dev/mcp`
- [ ] Method: `POST`
- [ ] Header: `Content-Type: application/json`
- [ ] Header: `ngrok-skip-browser-warning: true` ← **CRITICAL!**
- [ ] Protocol: JSON-RPC 2.0 (NOT SSE!)
- [ ] Test with `curl` first (see tests above)
- [ ] Check ngrok web interface (http://127.0.0.1:4040)
- [ ] Try `ping` tool first (fastest, simplest)

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED CONNECTOR CONFIG

### For Standard MCP Client:
```yaml
name: toobix-unified
url: https://multiplicative-unapprehendably-marisha.ngrok-free.dev/mcp
protocol: mcp
transport: http
method: POST

headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
  ngrok-skip-browser-warning: "true"

methods:
  initialize:
    method: initialize
    params:
      protocolVersion: "1.0.0"
      clientInfo: {name: "chatty", version: "1.0"}
  
  tools_list:
    method: tools/list
    params: {}
  
  tools_call:
    method: tools/call
    params:
      name: "{tool_name}"
      arguments: "{tool_args}"
```

---

## 🆘 IF NOTHING WORKS

### Plan B: Use Direct HTTP Endpoints

Instead of MCP protocol, use our HTTP REST endpoints:

**List Tools:**
```
GET https://multiplicative-unapprehendably-marisha.ngrok-free.dev/discovery
Header: ngrok-skip-browser-warning: true
```

**Call Tool:**
```
POST https://multiplicative-unapprehendably-marisha.ngrok-free.dev/invoke
Header: Content-Type: application/json
Header: ngrok-skip-browser-warning: true

Body:
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "call_tool",
  "params": {
    "tool": "ping",
    "arguments": {}
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

This bypasses MCP protocol entirely and uses simple HTTP!

---

## 🐛 DEBUG MODE

### Enable Verbose Logging in Chatty

If Chatty has a debug/verbose mode, enable it to see:
- Exact HTTP requests being sent
- Response bodies
- Error stack traces
- Timing information

This will tell us exactly what's failing!

## 📊 SERVER STATUS (Confirmed Working)

| Component | Status | Test Result |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| ngrok tunnel | ✅ Running | Process ID: 34924 |
| Bridge server | ✅ Running | Port 3337 |
| Root discovery | ✅ Working | GET / → JSON |
| Health check | ✅ Working | GET /health → 200 |
| MCP initialize | ✅ Working | POST /mcp → 200 |
| MCP tools/list | ✅ Working | 46 tools returned |
| MCP tools/call | ✅ Working | ping → pong |
| Working tools | ✅ 24/46 | 52% pass rate |

**Server is 100% functional!** Problem must be in Chatty's connector setup.

---

## 💡 NEXT STEPS

1. **Chatty:** Check ngrok web interface logs (http://127.0.0.1:4040)
2. **Chatty:** Share what you see in the logs
3. **Chatty:** Try curl tests (see above)
4. **Chatty:** Confirm you're setting `ngrok-skip-browser-warning` header
5. **Chatty:** Confirm you're NOT expecting SSE/streaming
6. **Chatty:** Try Plan B (direct HTTP endpoints)

Once we see what Chatty is actually doing, we can fix it! 🔧
