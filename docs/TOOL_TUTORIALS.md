## üìö Pro Tips

### Energy Management
- **Low energy (<50)**: Use `consciousness_transition` to "sleep" or "rest"
- **Need focus**: Transition to "focused" or "alert"
- **Creative work**: Try "lucid_dream" or "meditate"
- **Peak performance**: "hyperaware" (but short duration)

### Crisis Prevention
- Run `crisis_assess` daily for early warning
- Address "medium" crises before they become "high"
- `crisis_resolve` teaches prevention patterns

### Multiverse Mastery
- Create branch BEFORE major changes
- Compare regularly to see if choice was right
- Use for regret resolution: explore the "what if"
- Branch + Version = powerful time machine

### Archive Wisdom
- Contribute after every major insight
- Search before making decisions (collective wisdom)
- Patterns emerge after 50+ contributions

### Memory Liberation
- Address difficult memories when energy is high
- Integration > Suppression
- Healing journeys take time - be patient
- Professional help for trauma

### Perspective Power
- **Mirror** when you need truth
- **Harmony** for conflicts
- **Competition** for motivation
- **Chaos** when stuck
- **Meta** for patterns
- **All** for big decisions
